# Runtime Loop Plan

This is the working loop for moving Aetherion from contract-backed slices toward a stronger local runtime without drifting into deferred product surfaces.

## Source Alignment

- `docs/06-roadmap.md` keeps V1 TUI-first and expects the Local Supervisor, Event Ledger, policy, scoped lease, local file action, observation, verification, and replay loop before GUI, IM, browser, MCP/OAuth, or cloud workers.
- `docs/10-technical-strategy.md` assigns authority, policy, vault, ledger, and native execution to Rust while keeping the Agent Orchestrator prototype in TypeScript.
- `docs/13-schema-runtime-governance.md` says new work should close runtime loops before expanding schema surface, and that runtime/projection evidence must not become authority by convenience.
- `crates/supervisor/README.md` still marks production daemon lifecycle and stale runtime-lock recovery as out of scope.

## Loop

1. Plan against the current docs and code evidence before selecting a development slice.
2. Implement one runtime-closing slice that can be tested without expanding V1 surfaces.
3. Verify with the smallest test set that proves the slice plus the broader guardrails.
4. Review the result against the source docs and record any remaining boundary.

## Current Increment

Target: supervisor runtime status should expose whether a foreground supervisor runtime lock points at a live, missing, unknown, or invalid owner process.

Why this slice:

- It advances the daemon-readiness path without claiming a production daemon exists.
- It reuses the existing Rust PID liveness check already used for Ledger append locks.
- It is read-only: status must not append Ledger events, repair lock files, remove stale locks, or grant authority.

Acceptance:

- `supervisor.status` returns process liveness and stale status for `.aetherion/supervisor.lock`.
- TUI `supervisor status` prints the new fields.
- Existing no-lock and live-lock status paths remain read-only.
- A stale lock is reported as evidence for operators, not repaired automatically.

Next likely increment after this one:

- Choose between typed supervisor lifecycle commands (`supervisor start/status/stop` preflight semantics) or a small durable queue/wake runtime slice, based on the same docs review.
